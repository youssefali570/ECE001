        Applications of Artificial Intelligence

        
        </h2>
      
        <p>  The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. </p>
        <p> Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.

 </p>
    <p> Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

        <tr> <td> The field of AI goes back to the 1940’s. This concept grew academically in the 1950’s and through government-sponsored projects in the 1960’s. Finally, funding eventually died in the 1970’s.<br>The next phase was in the 80’s where AI techniques were being moved from academic applications into the business world. During this time it was discovered that AI could be used to predict stock prices allowing it to solve more complex business problems.<br> During the 80’s and 90’s, robotics entered factories, showing the potential for machines to completely change an industry. Hence, this created a fear and backlash against AI technology, slowing its growth again.            
 </td> 
            <td>   In recent years, we have seen a significant surge in Artificial Intelligence technologies, such as robotics being used for surgeries and the third generation of AI – The Era of Deep Learning. Therefore, we can see innovation happening at a fast pace, with leaders such as Google using deep learning algorithms to create predictive models.<br> Furthermore, AI is already being used many scale applications. The most common examples are:
<ol> <li> Vacuum cleaners
 </li> 
                <li> Smart cars
 </li>
<li> Self-driving cars
 </li>  
    <li> Personal assistant robots

 </li>
                </ol>
                These are representative of the uses of AI today, and we are regularly seeing new milestones in AI technology.
<br>
                AI is transforming many aspects of business functions, and software development is no exception to this. Traditionally, developing a computer program requires you to specify exactly what you want the system to do and then engineer all of the features yourself. However, I’m sure you know that some tasks are too difficult to teach computers to do. Enter AI techniques such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. A machine learning model can deduce what features and patterns are important, without a human encoding this knowledge. The outputs of some ML models can even surprise humans and highlight details that we hadn’t thought about.

            <td>  In the future, AI will continue to grow in a way that will enable new business models and functionalities.
It will also play a key role in improving quality of life through allowing humans to complete tasks more efficiently and in less time.<br>
                Although we cannot be sure of the exact future, it is quite evident that interacting with AI will soon become an everyday activity. These interactions could help our society evolve, particularly in regards to automated transportation, solving climate change, and improving the care of the elderly. Beyond these few impacts, there are even more ways that AI technology can influence our future.
